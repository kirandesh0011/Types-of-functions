# CurrencyToken

CurrencyToken is a simple Ethereum token (ERC20) smart contract written in Solidity. It allows you to create and manage your own digital currency on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **Minting Tokens**: As the owner of the contract, you can create new tokens and assign them to any Ethereum address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Any token holder can destroy their tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Token holders can send tokens to other Ethereum addresses.

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the contract.
- Knowledge of Solidity for customization.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the Solidity code into your project.
2. Compile the Solidity code using a Solidity compiler.
3. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a deployment tool.

## Usage

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using any Ethereum wallet that supports ERC20 tokens.

### Minting Tokens

Call the `mintTokens` function to create new tokens and assign them to a specific Ethereum address.

### Burning Tokens

Any token holder can call the `burnTokens` function to destroy a specific amount of their tokens.

### Transferring Tokens

Token holders can transfer tokens to other Ethereum addresses using the `transferTokens` function.
